              What Does USD/CHF Mean?
            </h2>
            <p>
              The exchange rate between the US Dollar (USD) and the Swiss Franc (CHF) is shown as USD/CHF. In basic words, it tells you how many Swiss Francs you need to buy one U.S. Dollar.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if USD/CHF = 0.9200, it implies 1 USD is worth 0.92 CHF.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because both currencies are regarded as solid reserves, this pair is called a safe-haven pair. The Swiss Franc is stronger when there is uncertainty throughout the world, which is why USD/CHF is a popular hedging instrument.
